= Smooth communication

== Cooperation with related parties smoothly

The preparation system of the manual varies from company to company.

1. Engineers create manuals as part of their work
2. Obtain information from engineers and create by user support department
3. Obtain information from engineers and create by manual specialized department

In either case, communication between departments is important.

Specification change will occur several times until the product is released and delivered. Also, after the release, manual revision by version upgrade etc. was done, load of version number and change history of manual data was high.

"Information from engineers is difficult to summarize"
"Data sharing of manuals and documents is complicated, and it takes time and effort to manage data."
"History management of correction tends to be complicated"

*By using GitHub, it is easy to manage file generations and manage correction history.*
*It will be possible to check detailed history such as who, when and what modifications were made.*

== Descriptive form with affinity for engineers

By adopting a descriptive form familiar to engineers such as Markdown, Asciidoc, reStructuredText (Lightweight Markup Language), you can create a manuscript without stress.
There are cases where "lightweight markup language" is used along with Word, Excel, PowerPoint at the development site.
The text formats used at the development site are as follows.
